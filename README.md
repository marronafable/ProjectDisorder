ProjectDisorder
=======================

Introduction
------------
The developers have successfully developed an ontology-based classification expert system for child developmental disorders. To achieve that, 
the group has successfully integrated the ontology into the web-based expert system designed without modifying the original structure of the ontology. The 
developers had only added to the existing body of information in the form of questions derived from manifestations of disorders as stored in the ontology.  
Also, the questions that have been added to the ontology serve to add to to the existing body of information on child developmental disorders. The group has also successfully made the web-based expert system 
dynamic, making it capable of displaying any updates and changes to the information in the ontology without requiring changes to the systemâ€˜s code. This 
feature allows future developments in this ontology to be seamlessly integrated into the web-based classification expert system. 
The group is in the process of migrating this system to an online host, making it available to the public. This is because the group believes that this 
ontology-based classification expert system can serve as a tool to provide awareness to local health communities and help remedy social ignorance on 
child developmental disorders by supporting diagnosis of disorders based on the existing ontological framework on this domain. It will also serve as a tool for interoperability and browsing of the distributed registry for child disorders.

Installation
------------

Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies using the `create-project` command:

    curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --
    php composer.phar create-project -sdev --repository-url="https://packages.zendframework.com" zendframework/skeleton-application path/to/install

Alternately, clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped
`composer.phar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git
    cd ZendSkeletonApplication
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)

Another alternative for downloading the project is to grab it via `curl`, and
then pass it to `tar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    curl -#L https://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication/tarball/master | tar xz --strip-components=1

You would then invoke `composer` to install dependencies per the previous
example.

Using Git submodules
--------------------
Alternatively, you can install using native git submodules:

    git clone git://github.com/zendframework/ZendSkeletonApplication.git --recursive

Web Server Setup
----------------

### PHP CLI Server

The simplest way to get started if you are using PHP 5.4 or above is to start the internal PHP cli-server in the root directory:

    php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network
interfaces.

**Note: ** The built-in CLI server is *for development only*.

### Apache Setup

To setup apache, setup a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go! It should look something like below:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName zf2-tutorial.localhost
        DocumentRoot /path/to/zf2-tutorial/public
        SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
        <Directory /path/to/zf2-tutorial/public>
            DirectoryIndex index.php
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
